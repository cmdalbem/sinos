 * improve guideline (include reflection on table walls, maybe collision with balls)

 * more realistic way to calculate collision vectors (theres a prototype based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elastischer_sto%C3%9F_2D.gif)

 * map texture on a quadric sphere

 * make Display be called only when possible (and not every time variables are updated).

 * sounds and music (suggestion: irrKlang lib)

 * collision detection with Table Frame (idea: use table's normals on reflection calculation of ball's vector)
