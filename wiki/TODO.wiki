Ordered by importance:

 * friction as a vector, and not as a constant multiplicating the speed

 * sound effects and music (for both, suggestion: irrKlang lib)

 * more realistic way to calculate collision vectors (theres a prototype based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elastischer_sto%C3%9F_2D.gif)

 * more game styles and more levels

 * improve guideline (include reflection on table walls, maybe collision with balls)
